> /əˈdʒɪˈpaɪ/, portmanteau of AgI (chemical formula of silver iodide) and Python

`agipy` enables you to destroy cloud infrastructure in a hurry. Whether you want to destroy a demo
environment you no longer need or want to purge artifacts a colleague left behind, `agipy` is here
to help you dissolving your cloud problems.

## About the name

`agipy` is a portmanteau of the chemical formula AgI for silver iodide and the word Python.

Silver iodide is a chemical used for [cloud seeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding#Methodology).
Cloud seeding is a weather modification that changes the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds;
in my opinion that is an appropriate metaphor for deleting cloud infrastructure, especially compared to
alternatives that include "nukes" or "EMPs".

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is the language `agipy` is implemented in. It is a great language for
everything concerning cloud infrastructure and automisation, and it happens to be the language I feel most
comfortable with.

## How to use `agipy`

To find out how the CLI works, use the built-in help function:

```sh
agipy --help
```

`agipy` is based on the concept of _providers_: For each public cloud provider, a `agipy`-specific
provider module has to be implemented. At the moment, the following provider modules exist:

* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

Because each provider has its own semantics, please refer to the respective subsection.

### How to use the `azure` provider

As of yet, the `azure` provider is capable of deleting all resource groups with a specific prefix.
For using the provider, you have to set the following environment variables:

* `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, the service principal ID
* `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, the service principal secret
* `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
* `AZURE_TENANT_ID`

Then you can call the provider via:

```sh
agipy azure --prefix=${RG_PREFIX}
```

## How to Test

The test suite is based on the great [`pytest`][1] library. Once installed, the automatic test
discovery can be used via

```sh
pytest agipy
```

## How to Contribute

This project is released under the GPL license, so I am happy for contributions, forks, and feedback!
This can be done on many ways:

* Open PRs with improvements,
* add issues if you find bugs,
* add issues for new features,
* use `agipy` and spread the word.

PRs have to comply with:

* [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
* [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org),
* and [`pylint`](https://www.pylint.org).

New features must be covered by proper tests (idealy unit tests and functional tests) using the [`pytest`][1] library.
